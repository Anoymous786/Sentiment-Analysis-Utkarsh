# 🎭 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

A web-based deep learning application that classifies movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** using a trained **LSTM model** and an interactive **Streamlit UI**.

This project helps demonstrate the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for text classification tasks.
